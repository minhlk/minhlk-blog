## Redux 
- **Global state management** for React 
- **Flow**: Action creator dispatch an action to reducer -> Reducer will use that data and store to global state (Store).

## Redux toolkit
- Provide a **boilerplate** and simplify common Redux tasks: create Action Creator, Reducer
- Main functions:
    - **createSlice**: create a slice of a global state (Redux store)
    - **createAsyncThunk**:
        - Create an async Action Creator
        - Provide 3 action types: pending, fulfilled, and rejected
- Integrate with **Redux DevTools** for easily monitoring/debugging
