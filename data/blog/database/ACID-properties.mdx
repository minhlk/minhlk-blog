## ACID Transactions
- 4 properties of a transaction in a DBMS
- Atomicity 
    - All operations are success - one failed then rollback whole operations
- Consistency
    - Data remain consistency before and after a transaction. (Enforce integrity constraints)
    - E.g: if the server down in the middle of transaction, data won’t be updated
- Isolation
    - Any read, write operation won't be impacted by read, write of other transactions.
    - Concurrent control.
- Durability
    - Once committed, can’t not rollback
